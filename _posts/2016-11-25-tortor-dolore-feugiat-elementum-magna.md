Donors interact as philanthropic individuals and organizations who find value in knowing that they are contributing towards maximizing the effectiveness of their, and otherâ€™s, donations. The platform is valuable for them to discover a realistic view of the mission, impact, and pains of various Beneficiaries, allowing a closer connection to the organization and its cause. Through the platform, the Donor gains the transparency of knowing that they are donating to an effective system that drives effective resource management and effective execution of missions they are aligned to. Further, the platform allows Donors to be more than just passive third-party contributors, granting them the ability to have a voice in the causes they donate to. The result being a more compelling reason to donate that provides greater fulfillment and sound of mind.
